# Chatbot
A simple chatbot programmed to respond to specific responses.

##Process
I just wanted to explore the pieces of a basic chatbot. The original chatbot was coded in Python. I borrowed code and learned from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea9jgBjQxEs 

I translated the code to JavaScript and made a working chatbot website that can respond to a small number of prompts.
